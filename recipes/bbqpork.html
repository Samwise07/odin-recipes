  <h1>Best Damn Pork</h1>

  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is the best pulled pork recipe. It is made in a dutch oven, 
        it does take a little bit of time and effort but it is 
        so worth it!</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 lb boneless boston butt</li>
      <li>4 tbsp conola oil</li>
      <li>2 tbsp paprika</li>
      <li>2 tbsp salt</li>
      <li>2 tsp ground pepper</li>
      <li>1.5 tsp garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 tsp oregano</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Step by Step Insturctions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat the oven to 300°F.</li>
      <li><strong>Prepare the spice mixture.</strong> In a small bowl, 
          combine the paprika, salt, pepper, garlic powder and oregano; 
          mix until well-combined.</li>
      <li>Dive the pork into 4" chunks. Dunk each side of the pork into 
          the spice mixture, covering all sides.</li>
      <li>Heat a dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add your fat of choice 
          and heat until shimmering. Add a batch of pork in a single layer 
          (about 4 pieces). Sear until a good crust forms, about 4 minutes. 
          Turn the pieces and brown one more side. Remove using tongs and 
          set aside. Repeat with the remaining pieces, searing at least 
          2 sides per piece. To ensure optimal browning, leave room between 
          each piece of pork and add more cooking fat as needed.</li>
      <li>Transfer all pork pieces back to the dutch oven and arrange in a 
          single layer at the bottom of the pot – for this stage it's 
          totally fine for the pieces to be touching, and the fit will be 
          snug. Pour ½ cup water over the pork pieces.</li>
      <li>Cover and transfer to the oven. Braise in the oven for 3-4 hours, 
          or until the meat easily pulls with a fork. In the last hour, 
          remove the lid to allow any remaining moisture to cook off and 
          for the pork to render (cook down) in its own fat.</li>
      <li>Remove the pot from the oven, then transfer the pieces to a 
          cutting board or shallow bowl. Shred using two forks, 
          discarding any intact fatty pieces. Return the pulled pork 
          to the pot and toss in the rendered pan sauce. 
          <strong>Serve immediately on buns with coleslaw.</strong></li>
    </ol>
